Thirty-one felled black cherry trees were measured.  The trees volume(cubic feet), girth(diameter in inches), and height(ft) was recorded.

Basic linear regression models can try and predict the height of a tree given girth and volume.  

This shiny app shows plots of height by girth and height by volume.  The models include predicting using only girth, only volume, and both girth and volume.

Use the slider to choose the volume and girth of your tree and try and predict its height using the 3 models.
